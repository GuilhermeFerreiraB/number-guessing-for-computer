# number-guessing-for-computer
An algorithm in which the user chooses a number between 1 and a chosen limit number as the argument for the function. After that, the computer will try guessing which number it is and the user will guide it by writing if the number guessed it too low, too high or correct. The program ends when the computer guesses the correct number.
